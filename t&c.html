                                Ryra Investments Limited trading as and owning the trademark RIPAY [herein after
                                referred to as RIPAY] provides an Android application. The Android application allows
                                users to obtain a credit advance or a loan (“credit advance”). The maximum credit limit of
                                this advance will vary by the borrower’s credit score and repayment history, amongst other
                                factors. Charges associated with the advance include a technology service fee (“service fee”),
                                which typically varies between 10-20% of the advance amount per 15- 30 day advance
                                period, as well as any associated telecom network distribution costs which are paid by the
                                borrower directly to the telecom. The recipient is then required to pay back the advance plus
                                a service fee on the total amount according to the repayment schedule specified at the time of
                                the credit advance offer. The terms of each credit advance, including the amount of the
                                advance, repayment schedule, applied service fee, and other associated fees will be displayed
                                with the credit advance offer. This User Agreement (together with our Privacy Policy and the
                                credit advance offer pages) sets out the complete terms and conditions (the &quot;Terms and
                                Conditions&quot;). The Terms and Conditions and any amendments or variations thereto take
                                effect on their date of publication. By accepting the credit advance, you acknowledge that
                                you have read, agreed with and accepted all of the Terms and Conditions, including the
                                following statement: “I authorize Ripay to access any information available to assess my
                                application, and also give Ripay to register details of the conduct of your account with Credit
                                Reference Bureau, and you waive any claim you may have against Ripay in respect of such
                                disclosure. I authorize Ripay to access your credit history from a registered credit reference

Without prejudice to Our rights under clause 13.1, We may at our sole discretion suspend or close your Account: if you use the Account for unauthorized purposes or where We detect any abuse/misuse, breach of content, fraud or attempted fraud relating to your use of the Services; if We are required or requested to comply with an order or instruction of or a recommendation from the government, court, regulator or other competent authority; if We reasonably suspect or believe that you are in breach of this Agreement (including non-payment of any a credit advance amount due from you where applicable) which you fail to remedy (if remediable) within 14 days after the service of notice by email, SMS or other electronic means requiring you to do so; where such a suspension or variation is necessary as a consequence of technical problems or for reasons of safety; to facilitate update or upgrade the contents or functionality of the Services from time to time; where your Account becomes inactive or dormant; if Ripay decides to suspend or cease the provision of the Services for commercial reasons or for any other reason as it may determine in its absolute discretion; or if you breach any of the license Restrictions or the Acceptable Use Restrictions. If your Account has a credit balance at any time as a result of overpayment of your credit advance, you may issue a Request to Ripay for payment of such credit balance and Ripay will return any such balance to you, less any applicable fees, provided that such amount falls above the minimum transfer amounts specified by the relevant Mobile Money or Bank Provider. Termination shall however not affect any accrued rights and liabilities of either party. If we receive notice of your demise, we will not be obliged to allow any operation or withdrawal from your Account by any person except upon production of administration letters from a competent authority or confirmed grant of letters of administration or confirmed grant of probate by your legal representatives duly appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction.
